# Automatic-Street-Light-Controller
• Automatic Street Light Controller System aims to control street light with change of intensity of sunlight by using C++ 
  Programming.
• Reduced Power Consumption by 50% and Overall Budget of project is less than $5.

**Operation:**
It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible
region of our eyes(evening after Sunset) and goes OFF after Sun rises.

**Requirements of the Project:**
Software : Arduino IDE 1.8.15, App Inventor 2 Utility for Mobile App Development
Programming Language used : C++
Hardware : Microcontroller, Resistors, LDR(Light Dependent Resistor), Arduino UNO etc..,

**Activities Done:**
Developed Mobile Application which displays the reading of output voltage using App Inventor 2 Utility and GPS.
Configured the Hardware, written the code in C++ and then compiled and uploaded to Arduino UNO board using Arduino Software.
